Description:

This app contains four tabs. The first two tabs contain route information for both OCTA and Metrolink. The last two tab display the Map of both OCTA and Metrolink

In the first two tabs it is able to display all of the routes for both metrolink and octa in a table view format.
When you select a route you can get all of the stops for the specific route again in a table view format. 

When you select your stop you get detail information of that stop and a map view of the stop.

Finally for both the maps, you can zoom in and out both maps.

BUGS:

None that I know of.
